        <p style="color:dimgray;">Kongu Engineering College, one of the foremost multi professional research-led Institutions is
             internationally a recognized leader in professional and career-oriented education. It provides an integral,
              inter-disciplinary education - a unique intersection between theory and practice,passion and reason.
              The College offers courses of study that are on the frontiers of knowledge and it connects 
             the spiritual and practical dimensions of intellectual life, in a stimulating environment that fosters rigorous 
             scholarship and supportive community. This Institute is a great possession of the committed Trust 
             called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' in Erode District, Tamilnadu
        </p>
        <p style="color:dimgray;"> The word 'Kongu' refers to a region of the southern state of India and
        the term 'Kongu Vellalar' specially means the agricultural community, predominated in the west of
        Tamilnadu, which was deprived of educational facility in those days. To achieve technical excellence 
        in their rural areas, 41 philanthropists from different walks of life who realized the need for technical
        education for their region's economic strides, formed collectively a Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar
         Institute of Technology Trust' and they tried to promote and develop equality of opportunity for the 
         rich and the poor</p>
